Being able to navigate and control your computer without moving your hands from the keyboard is a beautiful thing.
In the beginning I was under the impression that learning a bunch of short cuts and installing an app or two was overkill.
Yet, believe me, once you start, you won't be able to stop. So, let me convert you by sharing some of the things I learned over
the last couple of years.

## The Basics

We will to be going over the standard keyboard shortcuts to control applications on Mac.
Ideally, you already know all of this and can skip straight to the [next section](#learn-more).

Top of the list must be `cmd + tab`. This gets rid of the pain of moving your mouse to the dock in order to find a running app to pull up.
Instead, this allows you to quickly switch through all your open applications by holding down `cmd` and pressing tab until the right app is in focus.
Next up is `cmd + q` to quit an app. Finally, `cmd + ~` to switch between windows of the same application.

## The Basics - Browser

This is going to be a larger set of commands. Most other apps luckily also use the same short cuts, so you'll be able to apply them in a variety of scenarios.

Controlling tabs: `cmd + t` to open a new tab, `cmd + w` to close a tab, `control + tab` to go to the next tab, and `control + shift + tab` to go to the previous one.

`cmd + l` can be used to instantly go to the search bar. This also works in the Spotify app, by the way. `cmd + n` opens a new window.

## Learning More With CheatSheet

Technichally, you can look up all the short cuts by scrolling through the menu bar of each app.

This little app allows you to pull up a list of all available commands by holding down `cmd`.

## [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)

Now, this is what you're really here for. Raycast is a supercharged spotlight alternative. It's quite similar to [Alfred](), but provides slighlty more functionality
with a nicer user interface. This app will allow you to hit `cmd + space` and control your entire computer by typing in the corresponding command. Community-built extensions
provide great integration with countless apps. In fact, I have written my [own two extensions](https://www.raycast.com/ratoru) for Raycast. It's so engrained into my workflow
by now that I would always install this first on a new computer.

Let's go through the setup. I recommend you set up an alias, e.g. `f`, for file search. This way, you'll be able to type `cmd + space` and `f + space`, which
will immediately launch file search. Next, I would enable key bindings for the window management extension. This way Raycast will be able to do what [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) does
without any additional installations. Lastly, I would recommend installing my [Google Maps Search](https://www.raycast.com/ratoru/google-maps-search) extension. This will let you pull up directions from your current location
to your home with one command.
