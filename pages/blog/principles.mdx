This is a collection of principles that guide every decision I make in my life. I share these openly in order to create a sense of accountability. Maybe you will disagree with one or some of these. I look forward to letting you convince me to update it. With a bit of luck, you will also be inspired to think about your own life principles. These can be especially useful during hard times - when one tends to lose track of who one wants to be. As you'll soon see, I don't believe I know what is best for you. So, please question everything you read here.

Heavily inspired by "Principles" by Ray Dalio.

## How to approach life

### Think

> Think for yourself to decide...
>
> 1. what you want,
> 2. what is true, and
> 3. what you should do to achieve #1 in light of #2,
>
> and do that with humility and open-mindedness so that you consider the best thinking available to you (Ray Dalio).

This is unquestionably first on my list. Only you can decide what you want out of life. Following this principle has a couple of important consequences:

Realize that your beliefs should change all the time since you (should) change as a person. Frequently come back to this point and review what you want. If your beliefs don't change, you are not learning!

You never know what is best for the other person. Much harm is done by people who think they know better.

Be open minded. "Don’t get hung up on your views of how things “should” be because you will miss out on learning how they really are" (Dalio). This does not mean you have to accept the way things are.

### Play

> The existence of the physical universe is basically playful. There is no necessity for it whatsoever. It isn't going anywhere. That is to say it doesn't have a destination that it ought to arrive at. It is best understood by analogy with music because music as an art form is essentially playful. We say you play the piano. You don't work the piano. Why? Music differs from say travel. When you travel you are trying to get somewhere. One doesn't make the end of the compositon the point of the composition. [...] People would go to concerts just to hear one crashing cord - cause that's the end. Same way [with] dancing: you don't aim at a particular spot in the room [thinking] that's where you should arrive. The whole point of the dancing is the dance. [...]
> We thought of life by analogy with a journey, a pilgrimage, which had a serious purpose at the end, and the thing was to get to that end, success or whatever it is, maybe heaven after you’re dead. But we missed the point the whole way along. It was a musical thing and you were supposed to sing or to dance while the music was being played ([Alan Watts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpaUICxEhk)).

I believe that playfulness - that mixture of creativity, experimentation, learning, excitement, and passion so commonly found in children - is instrumental to being happy. To put it into the words of Phil Knight in his book "Shoe Dog":
"Play. Yes, I thought, that's it. That's the word. The secret of happiness, I'd always suspected, the essence of beauty or truth, or all we ever need to know of either, lay somewhere in that moment when the ball is in midair, when both boxers sense the approach of the bell, when the runners near the finish line and the crowd rises as one. There's a kind of exuberant clarity in that pulsing half second before winning and losing are decided. I wanted that, whatever that was, to be my life, my daily life. (p. 3)"

### Be Grateful

Too easily do you fall into the trap of rushing through life. Pause. Realize that you've been gifted a chance to live. This is a true gift, since - as Alan Watts said - "there is no necessity for it whatsoever." In fact, there is no way of knowing if you'll be given another one. So, be thankful for what you are given. Disclaimer: Of course, this does not mean you can be thankful for everything. For a more nuanced argument check out [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtBsl3j0YRQ).

### Persist

"Realize that you are simultaneously everything and nothing — and decide what you want to be." - Ray Dalio

“There is only one failure for you and that is not to be true to the best you know.” - Jane Stanford

You have 30000 days in your life, 30000 chances to make the best out of your life.

"Let everyone else call your idea crazy... just keep going. Don't stop. Don't even think about stopping until you get there, and don't give much thought to where "there" is. Whatever comes, just don't stop. \[...\] I believe it's the best advice - maybe the only advice - any of us should ever give". - Phil Knight, Shoe Dog, p.5

### Sleep

Yup. That's the entire principle. It's that important.

### Love yourself

Realize that your mood / interpretation of the current situation mainly stems from your head and can therefore be changed.

Be able to laugh about yourself.

Don’t let fears of what others think of you stand in your way. Be confident.

Own your outcomes.

This too shall pass.

## How to improve

### Iterate

As Ray Dalio said "evolving is life’s greatest accomplishment and its greatest reward." In order to improve one has to try and fail first since "it is a fundamental law of nature that in order to gain strength one has to push one's limits, which is painful". To get the most out of these failures, be mindful and remember that **Pain + Reflection = Progress**.

![improve-cycle](/blog/dalio-improve-cycle.jpg)

Cherish the art of thoughtful disagreement.

A problem or concept that is too difficult for you does not exist. If you do not understand something, it is because there exists a simpler / more fundamental idea that you have not yet understood. In most cases, you don't even realize that you still need to learn a previous step.

### Build good habits

Naturally, you will spend most of your life in autopilot. Good habits ensure that you are still flying towards your original destination. Furthermore, good (small) habits compound.

## How to interact with others

### Kindness

"I expect to pass through this world but once. Any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness I can show to any fellow creature, let me do it now. Let me not defer or neglect it for I shall not pass this way again." - probably Stephen Grellet.

### Humility

“Yet, never will I proclaim my accomplishments. Let the world, instead, approach me with praise and may I have the wisdom to receive it in humility.” - Mandino, Og. The Greatest Salesman in the World.

### Be enthusiastic

Smile. People are drawn to positive energy. Give sincere appreciation.

### Listen

A wonderful way to achieve all the things I talk about here. It helps you realize how little you know, and makes the people around you happy. Understand that people do not think like you.

> Du gehörtest zu den Schlauen, die nie viel sagen, aber sehr viel staunen. // You belonged to the smart ones, that never said much, but were frequently amazed. - Gelernt von Käptn Peng

## How to make choices

Learning must come before deciding. If there is no cost to delaying the decision, there is no harm in waiting to gather more information.

Sleep over it.

Realize that you might be biased and can't recognize your own faults.

Follow these steps by Ray Dalio:

- One of the most important decisions you can make is who you ask questions of. Ask “believable” people.
- Don’t believe everything you hear.
- Everything looks bigger up close.
- New is overvalued relative to great.
- Don’t oversqueeze dots.

If you can, try to quantify your problems. This will help you decide how much time you should spend thinking about them. If you really can't decide, try flipping a coin.
